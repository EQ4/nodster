Nodster is a crawler that gets mp3 and stream them from any source.

/!\ This is super early work! At the moment it only crawls one website, but the idea is to crawl google and get as many source as possible. Test them, check their metadata, etc... and provide a mp3 to stream as fast as possible. If you wanna help, fork away!

This is just for fun and this is not a serious project as there is obvious legal issues.

If you want to try it, just put all these files in [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) and launch the `nw` executable.
