Nodster is a crawler that finds mp3 and stream them from any source.

/!\ **This is super early work**! If you wanna help, fork away!

This is just for fun and this is not a serious project as there are obvious legal issues.

If you want to try it, just put all these files in [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) and launch the `nw` executable.

Also you'll need to use the `ffmpegsumo.dll` I provided (because vanilla node-webkit doesn't read mp3s). It's the windows version. For Linux/MAC check the [popcorn-time repo](https://github.com/popcorn-time/popcorn-app/tree/master/libraries)
